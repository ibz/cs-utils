# cs-utils

Miscellaneous C# utility functions I wrote a long time ago (.NET 2.0 IIRC). Probably irrelevant today.

* `C.cs` - functions for working with collections (Map / Reduce / Filter ...)
* `M.cs` - functions for working with types
* `TrayIconFinder.cs` - find the position of icons in SysTray

NB: This code is very old and probably useless by now. The repository will be archived.
